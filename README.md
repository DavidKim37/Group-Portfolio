## Usage of different materials week 8

### Goals

#### Kyle Myint - https://github.com/kylem314/ChessOO/blob/master/AIBot.py

I completed my first 2 goals, spending most of my time this week planning out how to make and AI Chess bot.  More info on that, and what I decided to do is in comments in the file.  I began to gather data that we would need to evaluate moves - so far, I have a list of all of the possible moves that can be made, a dictionary of each of the AI's pieces and their values, and a dictionary of all of the AI's pieces that are being attacked, and which piece is attacking them.

Self-Grade: 23/25 - I figured out a method (that should work) to create a primitive chess AI bot, though it may be a lot of computation and I may have to optimize it in the future.  However, I was unable to finish most of it this week, and will continue working on it in the future.
