## Usage of different materials week 8

### Goals

#### Kyle Myint - https://github.com/kylem314/ChessOO/blob/master/AIBot.py

I completed my first 2 goals, spending most of my time this week planning out how to make and AI Chess bot.  More info on that, and what I decided to do is in comments in the file.  I began to gather data that we would need to evaluate moves - so far, I have a list of all of the possible moves that can be made, a dictionary of each of the AI's pieces and their values, and a dictionary of all of the AI's pieces that are being attacked, and which piece is attacking them.

Self-Grade: 23/25 - I figured out a method (that should work) to create a primitive chess AI bot, though it may be a lot of computation and I may have to optimize it in the future.  However, I was unable to finish most of it this week, and will continue working on it in the future.
Scrum Master Grade:  5/5- I think that Kyle meant to put a 19/20 (The remaining 5 points are by meeeeeeee). I am actually amazed that Kyle could put 3 days of researching and 1 day of code and produce a decent model.

#### David Kim
Goals at start of week:
self grade: _/20
Scrum Master Grade:  _/5

#### Colin Szeto 
Goals at start of week:
1. render multiple chess boards
2. Be able to take inputs and have the computer respond to the inputs	by editing dictionaries

I focused on Goal 2 to show mastery of jinja as provided on the 10/28/20 lecutre. I was unable to complete goal 1. 
implmentation of data file, I store the list which is used to display all of the sums that were calculated in the addition tab: https://bit.ly/3ecZSJb
able to use the form tag to recieve inputs from user: https://bit.ly/2TGBk1G
implement jinja for loops to print out all contents of list: https://bit.ly/2HSgFFb

example on using DOM to call for specific JS functions: https://bit.ly/37VGuPO
here is where the JS function is stored to communicate to the player what piece is stored:https://bit.ly/3edlFQY
here is what the player sees: https://bit.ly/2TDcQGy

self grade: 18/20
I can improve on organizing the team more on the journals. For the future I will want to get the forms and DOM to interface together to provide the player with the option of of dragable pieces as the UI. I hope to implement Jinja dictonaries to store the values of the chessboard and hope to pass it into js scripts to then convert them into interactive ui for the user. 
Scrum Master Grade:  5/5- Based on code, seems like good progress made through the week. I feel like he graded himself a bit harsh. - Devam Shrivastava

Scrum Master Grade:  _/5

#### Devam Shrivastava
Goals at start of week:
1. My only sole goal was to work with Kyle and get the Chess AI Bot up and running. I was expecting it to be quite time straining.

self grade:  17/20- I set my only goal to be to work on the AI piece since I expected that to take most of my time. As expected it did. I looked through many sources online on how to create the bot. In the end, I came up with a model, but didn't seem to work, so I collaborated with Kyle on his design of the single-player bot. I made some efficiency changes to the code, and tried to use a bit more classes in my new designs. Overall, I am lowering my grade since I failed in producing a working model, but I did help out in editing the code as I found some errors. I have commited and pushed any edits I have into my own branch rather than the master branch in order to stay away from any merging collisions.
Scrum Master Grade:  4/5- Could have been better with communication.


##### template

1.  Expectations are links to code.. My suggestion is README and Code, let porfolio, project and tangible artifacts do the talkin'.
2. 20 of 25 points by student and pair on goals, artifacts, and updates to journal.
3. 5 of 25 points by Scrum Master, Scrum master should be brief in award, should be based on artifacts produced and goals.
